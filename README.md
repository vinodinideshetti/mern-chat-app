**ðŸ“„ Task Description**
As part of my internship project, I developed a Real-Time Chat Application using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The primary objective of this project was to implement a live chat feature where users can send and receive messages instantly without needing to refresh the page.

I began by setting up the backend using Node.js and Express.js, where I created an API and established a server. For real-time communication, I integrated Socket.io, which allowed bidirectional communication between the client and server. This enabled features such as sending and receiving messages in real time. The server was configured to listen on a specific port and handle socket connections from the frontend.

On the frontend, I used React.js to build the user interface. I implemented message input functionality, a display area to show the conversation, and integrated Socket.io-client to connect with the backend server. The UI updates instantly as new messages are received, creating a smooth real-time chat experience. Basic use of React hooks like useState and useEffect helped manage state and socket events efficiently.

The frontend and backend were connected successfully, and communication was tested on localhost. Messages sent from one client were received and displayed instantly on another, confirming the real-time capability.

Version control was handled using Git, and the entire project was uploaded to GitHub. The repository contains both the server and client folders, maintaining a clean folder structure.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of real-time web applications, socket programming, and full-stack development using the MERN stack.
